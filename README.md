# CircleHash

CircleHash is a family of modern non-cryptographic hash functions.

CircleHash64fx is a 64-bit hash with a 128-bit seed.  It's fast, simple, and easy to audit.  By default, it uses fractional digits of **œÄ** as constants ([nothing up my sleeve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing-up-my-sleeve_number)).  It balances speed, digest quality, and maintainability.

CircleHash64fx is inspired by [Google's Abseil C++ library](https://abseil.io/about/) internal hash.  They pass every test in SMHasher (demerphq/smhasher, rurban/smhasher, and my stricter test suite).  Tests passed include Bit Independence Criterion, [Strict Avalanche Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect#Strict_avalanche_criterion), etc.

CircleHash64 comes in two flavors:

- üõ°Ô∏è **CircleHash64fx** supports 128-bit seed and shields against losing accumulated state from potential multiplication by zero. It's a bit slower than CircleHash64f but remains among the fastest for short inputs.

- üöÄ **CircleHash64f** supports 64-bit seed like Abseil LTS 20210324.2.  By default, CircleHash64f uses two different 64-bit constants rather than using the same 64-bit constant twice at finalization.

CircleHash64fx will be replacing CircleHash64f as the default hash.

Three CircleHash64f functions are currently used in production (on linux_amd64):

```Go
func Hash64(b []byte, seed uint64) uint64
func Hash64String(s string, seed uint64) uint64
func Hash64Uint64x2(a uint64, b uint64, seed uint64) uint64 
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Non-cryptographic hashes should only be used in software designed to properly handle hash collisions.  If you require a secure hash, please use a cryptographic hash (like the ones in SHA-3 standard).

## Comparisons

### Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC)

|                | CircleHash64f | Abseil C++ | SipHash-2-4 | xxh64 |
| :---           | :---:         | :---:  | :---: | :---: |

‚òùÔ∏è Using demerphq/smhasher updated to test all input sizes 0-128 bytes (SAC test will take hours longer to run).

## Why CircleHash?

I wanted a fast, maintainable, and easy-to-audit 64-bit hash function that's free of backdoors and bugs.  It needed to be very fast at hashing short inputs with at least a 64-bit seed.

It also needed to pass all tests in demerphq/smhasher, rurban/smhasher, and my test suite.  It was important to have sufficiently explained choice of default constants and avoid over-optimizations that increased complexity to the point of harming maintainability.

## CircleHash Design

I didn't want to reinvent the wheel.  After testing and evaluating existing hashes, I chose a slightly more conservative design than Go 1.17 internal hash and wyhash_final3 variants.  CircleHash64f is based primarily on [Abseil's](https://abseil.io/about/) internal hash (which was based on an older wyhash). CircleHash64fx is a larger departure from the original design and has support for 128-bit seeds plus other improvements.

> Abseil is an open source collection of C++ libraries drawn from the most fundamental pieces of Google‚Äôs internal codebase. These libraries are the nuts-and-bolts that underpin almost everything Google runs. [...] Abseil encompasses the most basic building blocks of Google‚Äôs codebase: code that is production-tested and will be fully maintained for years to come.

CircleHash64 currently uses CircleHash64f by default with 64-bit seeds.  Default hash will switch to CircleHash64fx which supports 128-bit seeds plus other improvements.

## Benchmarks

CircleHash64 is ideal for input sizes <= 512 bytes.  Larger inputs can be hashed faster using other CircleHash designs (not yet published).

For best results, it's better to run your own benchmarks on your own hardware with your most common data sizes.

Until detailed benchmarks are published, please view [Comparisons](README.md#Comparisons) for some preliminary results.

## Status

CircleHash64 is currently used in production on linux_amd64.  Other platforms may work but they are not officially supported yet.

The most important files are:

- circlehash64_ref.go -- reference implementation used by Go 1.16 and older versions.
- circlehash64.go -- faster implementation used by Go 1.17 and newer versions.
- circlehash64_test.go -- tests that verify digests with expected results for various input sizes using different seeds.  Rather than port SMHasher and other test suites to Go, the C++ implementation is used for those additional tests.

CircleHash64fx will replace CircleHash64f as the default hash.  CircleHash64fx supports 128-bit seeds and will include other improvements such as idiomatic and full-featured API.

## Release Policy

This project uses Semantic Versioning 2.0.  

As an exception, some variants of CircleHash may be declared stable before this repo reaches v1.0.  I.e. given the same input data, the hash function will always produce the same digest.  Such declarations will be noted in the README and applicable release notes.

CircleHash64f will be replaced by CircleHash64fx as the default CircleHash64.
